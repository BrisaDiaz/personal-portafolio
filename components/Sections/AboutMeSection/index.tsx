            cutting-edge web development technologies specialized in improving
            the user experience, development and scalability of digital

            I describe myself as a proactive, curious and determined person,
            passionate about providing solutions in a creative and ingenious way
            who {"don't "}hesitate to leave the comfort zone to face new
            challenges, seeing each of them as an opportunity to improve and
            bring value.
